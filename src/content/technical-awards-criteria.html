     <p>Nominations are due to the Visualization Technical Award Committee Chairperson not later than March 1st of the year for which the award is proposed. Nomination write-ups should carefully address the criteria below while not exceeding one page with a Times New Roman 12pt or comparably sized font.</p><div>IEEE VGTC Visualization Technical Achievement Award Criteria:</div><div>1. Significant Achievement in a focused area of visualization research will be the primary criteria. This may be either a major single development or a definitive sub-area of one of the visualization fields. The degree to which this research has helped expand the sub-field and the broader impacts resulting from the research (commercialization, research by others based upon the considered research, use of the results by others outside the field of visualization, etc.) will be a factor in distinguishing from among the significant research efforts being considered.</div><div>2. Service to the Community will be a secondary consideration. While primary emphasis will be on research achievement, service will be expected in all but extraordinary cases and the quality and quantity of service will be considered.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>IEEE VGTC Visualization Career Award Criteria:</div><div>1. Research over a long period of time which has impacted the field of visualization. Such research may be focused or broad-based.</div><div>2. Broader impacts on the field and on the community: research by others arising from the candidate&#39;s research, successful commercialization, impact on fields other than visualization, new educational thrusts, developing multiple, highly successful PhDs, etc.</div><div>3. Success in the development of new funding for the field, especially where the new funding played a major role in the development of new sub-areas of research.</div><div>4. Service to the community: significant service will be expected over a long time period, but special emphasis will be given for very significant, in-depth service achievements that have played a major role in the development of and obtaining recognition for the field of visualization.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Few candidates will have strengths in all four areas, but the totality across these areas will be considered with the research criteria expected. Note that the &quot;etc.&quot; in #2 covers any additional items not specified.</div>   </div>
