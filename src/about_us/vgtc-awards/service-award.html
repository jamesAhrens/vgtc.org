<h1>IEEE Outstanding Contribution Award</h1>

<p>A certificate awarded for an achievement of major value and significance to the Computer Society. The achievement should be a specific, concisely characterized accomplishment, as opposed to a collection of different efforts. The co-founders of the Visualization Conference received the Outstanding Contribution Award in 1994 for their achievement in initiating and developing the conference, the first of which was held in 1990.</p>
