## UPDATE 
Voting for the VGTC Chair will open on November 1, 2018 and run through November 26. When voting opens all eligible voters who have opted into receiving IEEE communications will receive an email with a link to the voting ballot. Additionally, the link will be posted on this page.



## Dear VGTC community,

The Visualization and Computer Graphics Technical Committee (VGTC) is electing a new chair and you are invited to cast your vote. The VGTC  Chair's term will run for two years, starting shortly after the election closes.

This email contains information about the candidates, instructions for becoming eligible to vote (and checking eligibility), and the role of the VGTC and the VGTC Chair.

The election will take place November 1-26. Once the voting opens we will include a link to the election here. Eligible voters will also receive an email directly from IEEE.

## CANDIDATES

As per the [VGTC charter](http://vgtc.org/content/charter) the Directors and current VGTC Chair nominated two candidates. The Directors solicited names and encouraged people to apply, sometimes by directly approaching potential candidates at workshops. The Directors then went through the list of candidates, prioritized it, and had one-on-one conversations with the top candidates.

The candidates nominated by the VGTC Directors are:

* [James Ahrens](/election2018/james-ahrens-statement)
* [Doug Bowman](/election2018/doug-bowman-statement)

Additionally, the voting ballot will offer an opportunity to write-in a candidate.

## HOW TO VOTE

To vote you must be a member of both the IEEE Computer Society and the VGTC. To receive a voting ballot you must have opted-in to receiving communications from IEEE. The details below cover the steps to ensure that you meet both these criteria. Specifically: 1) how to become eligible to vote; 2) how to check your voter eligibility; 3) how to opt into IEEE communications to receive your ballot; and 4) how to cast your vote.

### 1. BECOME ELIGIBLE TO VOTE

Go to [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org) and create a new account, or log into an existing account. While you are logged in, join [IEEE Computer Society](https://www.ieee.org/membership-catalog/productdetail/showProductDetailPage.html?product=MEMC016) and the [VGTC](https://www.ieee.org/membership-catalog/productdetail/showProductDetailPage.html?product=CMYVG731).

Membership in the IEEE Computer Society requires a yearly fee, while VGTC membership is free.

### 2. CHECK YOUR VOTER ELIGIBILITY

To check if you are eligible to vote log into your IEEE account. On your *My Account* page click the link in the left settings-navigation bar that says *Membership and Subscription History*. To be eligible to vote you must have an active IEEE Computer Society membership and an active VGTC membership listed here.

### 3. OPT INTO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS

Due to GDPR regulations, to receive a voting ballot you must be opted into receiving communications from IEEE. Log into your IEEE account. On your *My Account* page click the link in the left settings-navigation bar that says *Communication Preferences*. Click **Yes** for both *IEEE Survey requests* and *Local IEEE communications* (the top two radio buttons). 

### 4. VOTE

On November 1 instructions for casting your ballot will be sent to all eligible voters with opt-in communication preferences. A link to the ballot will also be posted to this page. To cast your vote, you will need your IEEE CS member number. To obtain a misplaced number, please visit the [IEEE missing number page](https://bit.ly/2pchkET). Voting closes on November 26.

## WHAT IS THE VGTC AND THE ROLE OF THE VGTC CHAIR?

The VGTC is the Visualization and Graphics Technical Committee, the governance body that oversees and sponsors all IEEE visualization and virtual reality conferences including VIS, VR, ISMAR, 3DUI, Pacific Vis, and EuroVis (as a co-sponsor). The VGTC is the main interface for these research communities with the IEEE Computer Society, and also maintains close ties with the publications TVCG (Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics) and CG&A (Computer Graphics and Applications). 

The VGTC fulfills many important roles including: approval and oversight of conferences, symposia, and workshops; oversight of publications through interactions with the IEEE CS Publications Board; getting involved in policy and budget decisions at the IEEE CS-level that affect the research community; and awarding the IEEE VGTC Career and Technical Achievement Awards.

The VGTC Chair directs the VGTC and oversees the VGTC budget while also advocating to the upper levels of IEEE on policy decisions. 

The VGTC Chair is the only elected position within VGTC that is determined directly by the membership. The Chair has the authority to directly appoint many positions including most of the voting members of the VGTC Executive Committee, some members of the VIS Executive Committee, and one member of the VR and ISMAR steering committees. After the Chair term ends, the Chair joins other previous Chairs on the VGTC Executive Committee as a VGTC Director.
