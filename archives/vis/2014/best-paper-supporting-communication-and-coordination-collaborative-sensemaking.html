Sharing externalizations (recorded information \ such as notes) could increase awareness and assist with team communication and coordination. However, we currently know \ little about how to provide tool support for this sort of sharing. We explore how linked common work (LCW) can be employed within \ a ???collaborative thinking space???, to facilitate synchronous collaborative sensemaking activities in Visual Analytics (VA). Collaborative \ thinking spaces provide an environment for analysts to record, organize, share and connect externalizations. Our tool, CLIP, extends \ earlier thinking spaces by integrating LCW features that reveal relationships between collaborators??? findings. We conducted a user \ study comparing CLIP to a baseline version without LCW. Results demonstrated that LCW significantly improved analytic outcomes \ at a collaborative intelligence task. Groups using CLIP were also able to more effectively coordinate their work, and held more discussion \ of their findings and hypotheses. LCW enabled them to maintain awareness of each other???s activities and findings and link \ those findings to their own work, preventing disruptive oral awareness notifications.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fvis%2F2014%2Fbest-paper-supporting-communication-and-coordination-collaborative-sensemaking">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
