Our method uses no environmentally tethered tracking devices and localizes a pair of near-range and far-range RGB-D cameras mounted on a head-worn display and a moving bare hand in 3D space by exploiting depth input data. Depth perception is enhanced through egocentric visual feedback, including a semi-transparent proxy hand. We implement a virtual hand interaction technique and feedback approaches, and evaluate their performance and usability. The proposed method can apply to many 3D interaction scenarios using hands in a wearable AR environment, such as AR information browsing, maintenance, design, and games.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fismar%2F2014%2Fst%2Fwearhand-head-worn-rgb-d-camera-based-bare-hand-user-interface-visually">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
