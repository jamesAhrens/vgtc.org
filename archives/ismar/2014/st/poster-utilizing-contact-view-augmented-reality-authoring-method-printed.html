The visualized data comes from many different data sources. One increasingly important source of data is user generated content. Unfortunately, AR tools that support user generated content are not common hence the majority of augmented data within AR applications is not generated utilizing AR technology. In this paper we discuss the main reasons for this and evaluate how the contact-view paradigm could enhance annotation authoring process within the class of tabletop size AR workspaces. This evaluation is based on a prototype that allows musicians to annotate a music score manuscript utilizing freehand drawing on top of device screen. Experimentation showed the potential of contact-view paradigm as an annotation authoring method that performs well in single and collaborative multi-user situations.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fismar%2F2014%2Fst%2Fposter-utilizing-contact-view-augmented-reality-authoring-method-printed">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
