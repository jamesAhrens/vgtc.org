Our method uses a predefined 3D model of a target object for tracking and deformation. A camera pose relative to the target object is estimated using 3D model-based tracking. Object region in camera image is obtained by projecting the 3D model onto image plane with the estimated camera pose, and a texture map is extracted from the object region and mapped to the 3D model. Then a texture-mapped model is rendered based on a mesh deformed by user via Laplacian operation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method provides user interactions with 3D real objects on real scenes, not augmented virtual contents.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fismar%2F2014%2Fst%2Fposter-interactive-deformation-real-objects">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
