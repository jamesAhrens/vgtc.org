Despite common technical problems, such as having a proper field of view, weight, and other problems concerning the miniaturization of these systems, a crucial aspect for AR relies also in the calibration of such a device with respect to the individual user for proper alignment of augmentations. Our demonstrator shows a practical solution for this problem along with a fully featured example application for a typical maintenance use case based on a generalized framework for application creation. We depict the technical background and procedure of the calibration, the tracking approach considering the sensors of the device, user experience factors, and its implementation procedure in general. We present our demonstrator using an Epson Moverio BT-200 OST-HMD.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fismar%2F2014%2Fst%2Fdemo-user-friedly-calibration-and-tracking-optical-stereo-see-through">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
