Insight is a mobile AR Web browser that executes HTML5-based AR applications. By extending physical objects and places with a uniform resource identifier (URI), we could build objects of interest for mobile AR application as document object model (DOM) elements and control their behavior and user interactions through DOM events in standard HTML documents. A new CSS media type is defined to augment virtual objects to the physical objects. In this model, we introduce the concept of PLACE, which is the model of a physical space in which the user can be located. With this approach, mobile AR applications can be seamlessly developed as common HTML documents under the current Web eco-system. The advantages of the webized mobile AR, which is able to utilize all kind of Web resources without reworking, and its high productivity due to the seamless development of AR contents in HTML documents are shown with real-life use cases in various domains, such as shopping, entertainment, education, and manufacturing.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fismar%2F2014%2Fst%2Fdemo-insight-webized-mobile-ar-and-real-life-use-cases">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
