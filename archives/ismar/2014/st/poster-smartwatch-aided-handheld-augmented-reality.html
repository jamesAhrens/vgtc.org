This method is based on utilizing a smartwatch tethered to a smartphone, and it is designed to provide a more user-friendly experience compared to approaches based only on a handheld device, such as a smartphone or a tablet computer. The smart-watch has a built-in camera, which enables scanning objects without the need to take the smartphone out of the pocket. An image captured by the watch is sent wirelessly to the phone that performs Visual Search and subsequently informs the smartwatch whether digital information related to the object is available or not. We thereby distinguish between three cases. If no information is available or the object recognition failed, the user is notified accordingly. If there is digital information available that can be presented using the smartwatch display and/or audio output, it is presented there. The third case is that the recognized object has digital information related to it, which would be beneficial to see in an Augmented Reality view spatially registered with the object in realtime. Then the smartwatch informs the user that this option exists and encourages using the smartphone to experience the Augmented Reality view. Thereby, the user only needs to take the phone out of the pocket in case Augmented Reality content is available, and when the content is of interest for the user.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fismar%2F2014%2Fst%2Fposter-smartwatch-aided-handheld-augmented-reality">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
