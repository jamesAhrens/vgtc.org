For this reason, children suffering from autism need to follow special training in order to increase their ability to learn new skills and knowledge. These children have propensity to be attracted by the technology devices especially virtual animations. The interest of this research work is to explore and study the use of Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR) system for training the children with ASD based on Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) techniques. This system assists in teaching children about new pictures or objects along with the associated keyword or matching sentence in an immersive way with fast interaction. The preliminary prototype demonstrates satisfactory performance of the proposed AR/VR system working in laboratory conditions.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fismar%2F2014%2Fst%2Fposter-augmented-and-virtual-reality-system-training-autistic-children">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
