We go one step further and use the line of sight of the user to attach information. While any information may not conceal the view of the user, we displace the information by an angular degree and provide means for the user to capture the information by looking at it. With such an apporach we see a potential for faster resuming times of the original task for which a required information needs to be accessed. The demonstration shows a comparably complex primary task assisted by our gaze-mounted information and illustrates the inherent differences for information access w.r.t. conventional methods, such as listing action items at a fix position in space or on a screen.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fismar%2F2014%2Fst%2Fdemo-placing-information-near-gaze-user">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
