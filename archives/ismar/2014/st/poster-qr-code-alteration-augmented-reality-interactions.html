However, it is difficult to enable tangible interactions through which users may change 3D models or animations. It is because QR codes are automatically generated by the rules, and are not easily modifiable. Our goal was to enable QR code based Augmented Reality interactions. By analysis and through experiments, we discovered that some parts of a QR code can be altered to change the text string that the QR code represents. In this paper, we introduced a prototype for QR code based Augmented Reality interactions, which allows for Rubik's cube style rolling interactions.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fismar%2F2014%2Fst%2Fposter-qr-code-alteration-augmented-reality-interactions">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
