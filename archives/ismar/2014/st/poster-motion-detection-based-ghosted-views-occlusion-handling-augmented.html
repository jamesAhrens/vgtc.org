Computer vision and image processing techniques are used to extract natural features, from each video frame. These features will guide the assignment of transparency to pixels, in order to give the ghosting effect, while blending the virtual object into the real scene. Video sequences were obtained from traditional RGB cameras. The main contribution of this work is the inclusion of a motion detection technique to the scene feature analysis step. This procedure leads to a better perception of the augmented scene because the proper ghosting effect is achieved when a moving natural salient object, that catches users attention, passes in front of an augmented one.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fismar%2F2014%2Fst%2Fposter-motion-detection-based-ghosted-views-occlusion-handling-augmented">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
