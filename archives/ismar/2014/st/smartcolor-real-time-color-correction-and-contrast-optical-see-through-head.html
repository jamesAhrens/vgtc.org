Color-blending is a major usability challenge as it leads to loss of color encodings and poor text legibility. Color correction aims at mitigating color blending by producing an alternative color which, when blended with the background, more closely approaches the color originally intended. To date, approaches to color correction do not yield optimal results or do not work in real-time. This paper makes two contributions. First, we present QuickCorrection, a realtime color correction algorithm based on display profiles. We describe the algorithm, measure its accuracy and analyze two implementations for the OpenGL graphics pipeline. Second, we present SmartColor, a middleware for color management of userinterface components in OHMD. SmartColor uses color correction to provide three management strategies: correction, contrast, and show-up-on-contrast. Correction determines the alternate color which best preserves the original color. Contrast determines the color which best warranties text legibility while preserving as much of the original hue. Show-up-on-contrast makes a component visible when a related component does not have enough contrast to be legible. We describe the SmartColor's architecture and illustrate the color strategies for various types of display content.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fismar%2F2014%2Fst%2Fsmartcolor-real-time-color-correction-and-contrast-optical-see-through-head">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
