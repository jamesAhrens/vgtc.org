The current prototype incorporates research evidence showing that physical activity can help improve ADHD-related symptoms. Physical activity is integrated with cognitively challenging tasks that may improve brain activity by encouraging goal planning and dedication. The current prototype is includes three mini-games, each of which teaches skills with real-life use potential. Players role-play as a young dragon in the story and virtual world as they repeat virtual tasks several times to gain mastery over real-life skills. Each activity is focused on a specific strength/weakness reported in children with ADHD, with game mechanics targeting ADHD diagnosis categories: specific hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention. This demonstration is based on the findings published in Hashemian, Y., & Gotsis, M. 2013, November. In Proceedings of the 4th Conference on Wireless Health (p. 12).
